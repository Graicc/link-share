# Link Share

Share links with your friends with RSS.

https://link-share.graic.net

Example: [My feed](https://link-share.graic.net/view/Graic)

Will eventually be replaced by [link-share-forever](https://github.com/Graicc/link-share-forever) so that I can promise that Link Share will be up for the rest of my life.
